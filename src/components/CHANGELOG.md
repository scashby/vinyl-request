---

## 2025-04-26

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breakage: Sides Fetch Attempt
- Fetching sides data introduced bugs.

### ‚úÖ Supabase Connection Hardening
- Switched Supabase credentials from env variables to **hardcoded** keys temporarily to stabilize production deployment.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Grid Display Broken
- After fallback cover fetching was expanded (Discogs/iTunes), album rendering broke.
- Discogs fetch began failing with 401 Unauthorized (token expired).
- Fallback covers failed due to missing tokens and CORS ‚Äî not fatal to album fetch itself.

---

## 2025-04-28

### ‚úÖ Root Cause Identified: Rendering / CSS Problem
- Confirmed that albums were fetched into memory successfully.
- Confirmed that filtering logic was working (not filtering all albums out).
- Identified that `.album-grid` structure existed but album-cards were missing/invisible due to broken mapping and missing fallback handling.

---

## 2025-04-28

### ‚úÖ Grid Restored
- Reverted `BrowseAlbums.js` to the last working backup version.
- Restored full album-grid and album-card structure.
- Ensured albums render even when covers are missing, with black fallback placeholders.
- Grid now displays correctly.

### ‚úÖ FilterBar Fixes and Filtering Logic Debugging
- Fixed broken media type filtering in `BrowseAlbums.js`.
- Identified that `FilterBar` was passing lowercase media types (`vinyl`, `cassette`, `45`) while `folder` values in Supabase were capitalized (`Vinyl`, `Cassette`, `45s`).
- Corrected comparison in `useEffect` to normalize casing: `album.folder?.toLowerCase() === mediaType.toLowerCase()`.
- Added debug logging to confirm album data and filter results.
- Confirmed `Vinyl` filter working; identified and resolved additional string mismatch with `Cassette` (was incorrectly singular in filter logic).
- Corrected `FilterBar.js` to pass exact values: `"Vinyl"`, `"Cassette"`, `"45s"`, `"All"`.

### ‚úÖ Shell Alias Management for Git Workflow
- Confirmed `pushit` and `pullit` are shell aliases defined in `.bashrc`.
- Created persistent aliases:
  - `pushit`: commits and pushes to `origin/main` with a custom message.
  - `pushit-working`: also creates a timestamped Git tag like `working-20250429-1532` and pushes it.
  - `pullit-working`: fetches and checks out the latest `working-*` tag from GitHub.
- Added all aliases to `~/.bashrc` with `source ~/.bashrc` to persist across sessions.

# ‚úÖ Status as of 2025-04-29

- Album browsing fully restored and filtered by artist, title, and folder (Vinyl, Cassette, 45s).
- Search bar and filter bar both working as intended.
- Album grid renders even without image assets using fallback placeholders.
- Git workflow improved with custom aliases and version tagging.

---

# üìã Next Steps (planned)

- Reintroduce track side selection (A‚ÄìF) from external source with Discogs fallback.
- Add support for customer vinyl override queue entries with admin mode.
- Replace expired Discogs token or switch to alternate metadata source.
- Begin editable tracklist integration for album sides and request form context.
